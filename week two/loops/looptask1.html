           1. Make a program that prints all positive numbers that are odd and smaller than 100 starting from 1. (1 3 5 7 9 11…)
    </p>
    <input type="button" onclick="positiveOddNo()" value="positive Odd">
    <p>
           2.  Make a program that prints all positive numbers that are smaller than 100 and even, in this order: 
            2 98 4 96 6 94 … Print result in one line.
    </p>
    <input type="button" onclick="positiveEvenNo()" value="positive Even">  <p>
    3. Make a program that asks repeatedly from the user the distance (km) and time (h) and calculates average speed. 
    The program ends when user gives 0 for the distance. 
    (After getting 0, the program does not ask anything from the user.)
</p>
<input type="button" onclick="CalcSpeed()" value="speed Calculator"> 
<p>4. Make a program that asks 20 numbers from user. After that the program prints out how many of those numbers where even.</p>
<input type="button" onclick="twentyevenNo()" value="Count Even number"> 
<p>
   5.  Make a program that asks numbers from the user, until user gives 0 and then program ends. In the end program prints out average of the numbers.
</p>
<input type="button" onclick="averagetill0()" value="average"> 
<p>
    6. Make a program that asks 25 numbers form the user. In the end program prints out average of the numbers.
</p>
<input type="button" onclick="averagetill25()" value="print average 25">
<p>
    7. Make a program that ask first one number from the user. After that the program asks: ”Do you want to continue giving numbers?(y/n)”.
     If user answers y, the program continues to ask another number. 
    If user answers n, program ends. In the end program prints out average of the numbers.
</p>
<input type="button" onclick="averagewithyesno()" value="print average with yes no">
<p>
    8. Make a program that asks first how many numbers user wants to give to the program. After that program asks those numbers. 
    In the end program prints out the smallest number that user gave.
</p>
<input type="button" onclick="Smallestinlist()" value="Smallest in List entered">
<p>
    9. Make a program that asks ten numbers and in the end prints out two biggest numbers.
</p>
<input type="button" onclick="biggestinlist()" value="Boggest in List entered">
<p>
    10. Make a program that asks ten numbers. Program calculates and prints out sum and average, also prints out the smallest and biggest number.
